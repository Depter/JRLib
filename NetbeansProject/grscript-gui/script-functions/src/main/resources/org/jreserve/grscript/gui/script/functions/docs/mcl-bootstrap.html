        <h1>MCL-Bootstrap</h1>
        <p>
            The MCL bootstrap allows to bootstrap the Munich Chain-Ladder
            estimates. The method is described in the article <i>&quote;
            Bootstrap Estimation of the Predictive Distributions of Reserves
            Using Paid and Incurred Claims&quot;</i> by <i>Huijuan Liu</i> and 
            <i>Richard Verrall</i>. The bootstrap requires 3 input
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Set of residuals, containing the scaled residuals for the
                paid and incurred development factors and for the
                Incurred/Paid and Paid/Incurred claim ratios.
            </li>
            <li>Random Generator</li>
            <li>Process simulator</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Residuals</h2>
        <p>
            The ODP bootstrap method generates 4 pseudo factor and claim-ratio
            triangles from the supplied residuals. The calculation of these 
            residuals is described in the <a href="link-ratio-residuals.html">
            Link-Ratio Residuals</a> and <a href="claim-ratio-residuals.html">
            Claim-Ratio Residuals</a> sections.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Segments</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to define segments for the bootstrap process. If
            a segment is defined the residuals will be reshuffled only within
            the cells, belonging to the given segment. To fix a residual
            to a given place, simply define a segment which contains only
            the given cell.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Segments can be defined within the bootstrap definition as from-to 
            ranges, or by cells.
        </p>
        <pre>
    //Split a triangle with 10 accident periods to two
    //segments.
    segment {
        from(accident:0, development:0)
        to(a:10, d:4
    }

    //Lock the top-left cell to the same position
    segment {
        cell(0, 0)
    }
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Random Generator</h2>
        <p>
            A random generator is needed to reshuffle the residuals from 
            the residual triangle, and to simulate the process variance.
            In the current version only the default Java random generator
            is supported, but if it is desired, additional random 
            generators can be plugged in, by implementing the
            <i>org.jreserve.jrlib.util.random.Random</i> interface.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Per default the bootstrap uses an instance of the Java random
            generator. To plug-in other implementations or to set
            the seed, use:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>random(Random rnd):</b> where <i>rnd</i> is a custom
                implementation of the 
                <i>org.jreserve.jrlib.util.random.Random</i> interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>random(String type, long seed):</b> where <i>type</i>
                must be <i>&quot;Java&quot;</i>.
            </li>
            <li>Use builder syntax:
                <pre>
    random {
        type "Java"
        seed 1000
    }
                </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Process Simulator</h2>
        <p>
            For each projected claim the bootstrap method applies a process
            variance (see the examples). In the current version the follwing 
            process simulators supported for MCL-Bootstrap:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Constant:</b> no process variance is applied.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Gamma:</b> gamma distributin is used to add
                process variance to the projections.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Normal:</b> normal distributin is used to add
                process variance to the projections.
            </li>
        </ul>
